Demo: https://mashlightningbookstarter.gatsbyjs.io/

## Quick start

1. **Install dependencies.**
  
    Simply run the following command

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

4. **Build Project**
   
    Simply run the following commands

    ```shell
    yarn clean && yarn build
    ```

    The build artifacts will be found in the public directory. This can be hosted in any static site hosting platform such as Firebase Hosting, Netlify, ...etc


## Configuration

### Mash Configuration

  The mash config can be found in `gatsby-config.ts` under `mash` key. All settings can be changed there and it will be reflected across the app. In order to have Mash working correctly you will require a earner account. This can be created in the [Earner Dashboard](https://wallet.getmash.com/earn). The SDK value should not change.

### Gatsby Config

  The `gatsby-config.ts` file contains some top level metadata. Populate the data in `siteMetadata` and it will be automatically loaded in the site. 

  The **chapters** key is important for loading the table of contents. Configure your chapters + titles here. This is used to properly configure the table of contents and the order of the book. Omiting this will cause problems and the book won't load properly.

### Book Content

  The book content is found in `content/book`

  The book is setup using Markdown. The top of each markdown file there should be a section which identifies metadata the components will use to pre-populate chapter and section data automatically.

  ```
  ---
  chapter: 0
  section: 0
  free: true
  title: Dedication
  slug: dedication
  ---
  ```

  `slug`: The URL that will be shown in the browser

  `free`: Boolean flag that will let the Paywall component know if this content should be automatically shown

  Chapter and section are used for ordering the book content correctly.

  **Chapter 0** is used as frontmatter for the book. It is helpful to use this chapter number to add pages such as Legal, Dedications. 

### Styling

The book uses TailwindCSS for general styles. TailwindCSS is configured using `tailwind.config.js` and `src/styles/global.css`

To change the styling of the book simplify modify `src/styles/style.css`. This contains the general style for the markdown text when it is rendered in react.
